              Hi, my name is Haider and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">{"highly ambitious"}</span>,
              <span className="font-bold">{" self-motivated"}</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold">{" driven"}</span> software engineer
              based in San Leandro, CA.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I graduated from San Jose State University in 2022 at the age of 20
              with my B.S. in Computer Science. Although it is a mild accomplishment, 
              my age in relation to when I completed my Bachelors is not to boast. 
              Instead, it is to serve as an indicator that when I put my mind to 
              something, I get it done; even if it means putting my mind to it for 
              4 years straight.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            I am not looking for a place that will 
            ‚Äútake a chance on me‚Äù. I am looking for a place that will 
            give me the opportunity to add value to it!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy.
              Whether it be reading, playing basketball, travelling, 
              or even studying new concepts, I am always seeking new experiences 
              and love to keep myself engaged and learning new things.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I believe that you should{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
                never stop growing
              </span>{" "}
              and that&#39;s what I strive to do. I have a passion for
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and I am
              always open to new opportunities. üôÇ
